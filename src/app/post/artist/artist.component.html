    Perhaps the most famous artist in the world, is perceived by many as the
    'mad' artist, the man who painted in a frenzy or simply the tormented soul
    who cuts off his ear. His artistic genius is often overshadowed by those who
    see his paintings as mere visual manifestations of his troubled mind. Whilst
    in part this may be true, in reality his innovative and unique artistic
    style was of enormous importance to a host of artists who followed in his
    wake. Even when openly influenced by his predecessors or contemporaries his
    art remained identifiably his own, developing a distinctive style that
    failed to be accepted by the art-buying public in his own time. The career
    of Vincent van Gogh as a painter was short, but his paintings revolutionized
    artistic practice and styles. The intensity of his vision, his wonderful
    sense of color, and the extraordinary boldness of his technique created
    masterpieces that exercise a profound influence on the art of the twentieth
    century.
